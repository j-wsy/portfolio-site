# ðŸ‘‹ hi! i'm justin.

i'm currently a security incident responder at [TikTok USDS](https://usds.tiktok.com/what-is-usds), handling data sovereignty & privacy incidents.
  
i've worked in cyber security for 5+ years now (dang, time flies) across secops, risk, and consulting.

security can be pretty 'serious', so sometimes i also:
- make silly videos (coming soon)
- make [silly music](https://soundcloud.com/jusjusjusx)
- play [silly volleyball](/vb/)
